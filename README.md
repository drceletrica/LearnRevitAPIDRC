🎁Download StarterKit
Firstly, we need to download EF-pyRevit StarterKit.

I've spent weeks on this StarterKit to help beginners like you get started and get everything you might need.

It includes templates, code samples, resources, tutorials, docs and more!

It could be a paid product, but I made it FREE.

​

👇Or follow written instructions below.👇

💿 0. Install pyRevit
Before we begin we need to make sure that you have pyRevit installed. If not, open pyRevitlabs.io and download the latest installer (Blue button).


It will take you to the latest pyRevit release on GitHub. Scroll down to Assets to download the installer.

Choose the one I marked below.


💡Do not mistake with CLI installers.

​

Then run the installer and install like any other plugin.

📁1. Rename StarterKit Folder
Once pyRevit is installed, let's get back to the StarterKit you downloaded. Extract contents somewhere on your computer.


Inside you will find a template for pyRevit Extension as a folder structure..
​

It's a set of folders and files that will be your extension.

You will have to find .extension and .tab folders(blue) and rename them with the name of your extension, but make sure you leave suffixes the same.

e.g.

📁LearnRevitAPI.extension
📁LearnRevitAPI.tab​
​

Double check they end with the same suffix as before

e.g.

📁YourName.extension
​📁YourName.tab

​

📁 2. Point pyRevit to this folder
You are almost done!

Place you folder somewhere safe on your PC.
Common Places:

C:\Users\USERNAME\Documents\pyRevit_Extensions
C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\pyRevit_Extensions
Or Choose any other folder!
💡Don't overthink it, you can always change location.
​

Next you want to point pyRevit to this locaiton in settings.


Go To

Revit -> pyRevitTab ->
pyRevit Pulldown Menu
-> Settings


Inside Settings under Custom Extension Directories click on Add Folder.

Then point pyRevit to folder where you placed your '.extension' folder.

💡Make sure '.extension' is not in your path.


🔄️ 3. Reload pyRevit
Lastly, reload pyRevit and you will become a pyRevit Developer with your own custom Revit toolbar.

​


🔁 Click Reload Button in pyRevit Tab.
​

Click Yes in the pop-up form.

🙌Congratulations!
This is how it should look:


Isn't it Awesome?

💪Adjust To Your Own Needs
This toolbar is 100% customizable.

​

You can remove or add anything you want. Everything is based on a folder structure, and I recommend to go through it and compare to what you can see in Revit. It will make a lot more sense.

​

⌨️ Pro Tip: Use ALT+Click shortcut to open folder location of any button. It will help you navigate the folder structure.

​

If you want to learn more about this StarterKit, make sure you watch this video where I break it down and show how to customize it.

P.S.
Look at you - taking BIG steps toward becoming a Revit Automation Wizard🧙‍♂️ (or expert if you prefer boring corporate titles).
